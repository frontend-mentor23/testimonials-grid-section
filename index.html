      <h2 class="title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned were current, if not more so, in
        the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h2>
      <div class="bottom-text">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
        and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling
        - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
        Engeneer at a VR startup. "</div>

        The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standarts is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
        incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</div>

      <h2 class="title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <div class="bottom-text">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
        from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
        disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
        fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</div>
